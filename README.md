LineFollower_PID
A Line Following Robot (LFR) with PID control using Arduino Nano, TB6612FNG motor driver, 2 N20 motors, 7-sensor analog IR array, a custom 3D-printed chassis, and a PCB managing all wiring (power, motors, buttons, LED) except the sensor array.
Line Following Robot (LFR) with PID Control

This project is a Line Following Robot (LFR) built using an **Arduino Nano, a custom 3D-printed chassis, and PID control for smooth and accurate line tracking.  
A custom PCB handles almost all wiring connections — including motors, motor driver, power (7805 voltage regulator), LED indicators, and two push buttons for calibration and run operations. The 7-sensor analog IR array connects directly to the Arduino Nano.
